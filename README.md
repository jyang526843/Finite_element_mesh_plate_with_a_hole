## Introduction
This code is modified based on Dr. Siva Srinivas Kolukula's work:
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/44670-mesh-a-plate-with-hole

"Finite analysis of plate with hole is very common. For analyzing first step is to mesh the domain. In the present code, a plate with hole is meshed using TFI (Transfinite interpolation). A plate of length L and breadth, B is considered. In most of the analysis of plates, due to symmetry of the plate a 1/4th grid of the domain is sufficient. Here using 1/4th of the plate is discretized, a hole at the center of the plate of radius, R is considered."

I have finished generating conventional FE-coordinates and elements.
I also extend the code to consider some long rectangular shape plates.
